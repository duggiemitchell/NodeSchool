Learn the basics of Javascript

NodeSchool workshops focus on essential skills for using Node.js

#Want to get started?

You’ll need Node.js on your computer to get started with each of these. Then use npm (it comes with Node) to install each module with the command below it. Once installed, simply type the workshopper’s name to launch.

You will also need a Text Editor, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code.  My editor of choice is Atom for it's streamlined git intergration.  

From the command line enter <npm install -g javascripting> from your home directory.
